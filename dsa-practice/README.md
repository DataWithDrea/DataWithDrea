# Data Structures & Algorithms Practice

This folder contains my exercises and practice implementations of core data structures (such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs) and algorithms (searching, sorting, dynamic programming, etc.). I'm using these exercises to sharpen my problem-solving skills and prepare for technical interviews.

## Contents

- **LeetCode & HackerRank solutions**: Solutions to selected problems with explanations and time/space complexity analysis.
- **Implementation snippets**: Examples implementing fundamental data structures in Python, along with commentary on their operations.
- **Algorithm explorations**: Write-ups and code experiments for algorithms like binary search, sorting algorithms, recursion, and dynamic programming.

Feel free to explore and provide feedback!
