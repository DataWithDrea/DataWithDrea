# AI & Automation Projects

This folder contains projects where I'm exploring how to leverage artificial intelligence and automation to streamline workflows and solve real-world problems. Each project showcases a specific concept or technology I'm learning.

## MatchMaker AI

An intelligent resume matching tool that analyses candidate profiles and job descriptions to recommend strong fits. Built with Python and leveraging natural language processing libraries to parse and compare job requirements and resumes. See the `matchmaker-ai` subfolder for the working code and more details.

## Upcoming Ideas

- **Task automation scripts** — small utilities to automate repetitive tasks such as data scraping, report generation, or file organization.
- **Chatbot prototypes** — conversational agents using language models to assist with recruitment tasks or to answer FAQs.
- **AI-driven analytics** — experiments with machine learning algorithms to discover insights from recruiting and workforce datasets.

Stay tuned for updates as I continue learning and building.
