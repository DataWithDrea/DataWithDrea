## Portfolio Projects

### [AI & Automation Projects](ai-automation/)
Projects exploring how AI and automation can streamline workflows and solve real-world problems.

- **MatchMaker AI** – an intelligent resume matching tool that analyzes candidate profiles and job descriptions to recommend strong fits. Built with Python and leveraging natural language processing libraries. See the [matchmaker -ai subfolder](ai-automation/matchmaker-ai/) for code and documentation.
- **Upcoming ideas**:
  - *Task automation scripts* – small utilities to automate repetitive tasks such as data scraping, report generation or file organization.
  - *Chatbot prototypes* – conversational agents using language models to assist with recruitment tasks or answer FAQs.
  - *AI driven analytics* – experiments with machine learning algorithms to discover insights from recruiting and workforce datasets.

### [Data Structures & Algorithms Practice](dsa-practice/)
Exercises and practice implementations of core data structures and algorithms to sharpen problem solving skills and prepare for technical interviews.

- **Problem solutions** – selected LeetCode/HackerRank solutions with explanations and time/space complexity analysis.
- **Implementation snippets** – examples implementing fundamental data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs) in Python, along with common algorithm patterns.
- **Study notes** – condensed notes and resources summarizing key algorithmic concepts.

### [Full Stack Development Projects](full-stack/)
Experiments and projects that demonstrate full stack development skills across front end and back end technologies.

- **Portfolio Website** – a personal portfolio built with React.js on the front end and a Node.js/Express or Flask back end, showcasing projects and blog posts.
- **Task Manager App** – a CRUD web application using a RESTful API and a database (PostgreSQL or MongoDB) to manage tasks with user authentication.
- **E commerce Demo** – a simple online store implementing product listings, cart functionality, checkout and payment integration.
