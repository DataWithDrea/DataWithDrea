# Full-Stack Development Projects

This folder contains my experiments and projects that demonstrate full-stack development skills, spanning both front-end and back-end technologies.

## Project Ideas & Roadmap

- **Portfolio Website**: A personal portfolio built with React.js on the front end and a Node.js/Express or Flask back end, showcasing projects and blog posts.
- **Task Manager App**: A CRUD web application using a RESTful API and a database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MongoDB) to manage tasks, with user authentication.
- **E-commerce Demo**: A sample online store implementing product listings, cart functionality, checkout flow, and payment integration.

As I work through these projects, I'll document my process, share code, and reflect on lessons learned.
